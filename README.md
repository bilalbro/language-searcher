# Language Searcher Application

A very minimalistic web app to search for programming languages, built using `create-react-app`.

## Motivation

Hearing about this amazing tool, developed by the engineers at Meta, called `create-react-app`, I decided to give it a go, and that in building a simple web application to search for a given programming language from a list of over a hundred languages.

As it turns out, `create-react-app` is undoubtedly an immensely powerful tool to get started with a React application. It's very easy to set up; requires no transpilation step for a change; and is overall improves the developer experience. However, I am somehow not just convinced to use CRA for every single React application that I create. I'll defer the reasons of this for a later blog post at CodeGuage on Medium.
